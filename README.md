# Encore Platform SDK

Package platform is the SDK for communicating with [Encore](https://encore.dev) hosted services The
[Encore](https://encore.dev) Platform SDK provides APIs for Encore applications to use at runtime to communicate with
Encore hosted services. It is used by the [Encore Runtime](https://github.com/encoredev/encore/tree/main/runtime) as a
provide SDK for communicating with the Encore Platform, the same way the
[Encore Runtime](https://github.com/encoredev/encore/tree/main/runtime) uses the AWS or GCP SDKs under the hood.

It is not intended to be used by applications directly, and therefore it's API is not considered to be stable.
